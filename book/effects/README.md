# Commands and Subscriptions

The Elm Architecture is neat, but how do you interact with the world?! I want random numbers! What time is it? How do I send HTTP requests?

Things are not exactly like languages like JavaScript, Python, etc. So we need to start with some facts about how Elm actually works.


## `sandbox`

I have not made a big deal about it, but so far all of our programs were created with [`Browser.sandbox`][sandbox]. We gave an initial `Model` and describe how to `update` and `view` it.

You can think of `Browser.sandbox` as setting up a system like this:

We get to stay in the world of Elm, writing functions and transforming data. This hooks up to Elm&rsquo;s **runtime system**. The runtime system figures out how to render `Html` efficiently. Did anything change? What is the minimal DOM modification needed? It also figures out when someone clicks a button or types into a text field. It turns that into a `Msg` and feeds it into your Elm code.

By cleanly separating out all the DOM manipulation, it becomes possible to use extremely aggressive optimizations. So Elm&rsquo;s runtime system is a big part of why Elm is [one of the fastest options available][benchmark].

## `element`

In the next few examples, we will instead create programs with [`Browser.element`][element]. This will introduce the ideas of **commands** and **subscriptions** which will allow us to interact more with the outside world.

You can think of `Browser.element` as setting up a system like this:

Like before, you get to program in the nice Elm world, but these `Cmd` and `Sub` values can tell the runtime system to generate random values, ask about the current time, make HTTP requests, etc.

I think commands and subscriptions make more sense when you start seeing examples, so let&rsquo;s do that!

> **Note 1:** Some readers may be worrying about asset size. &ldquo;A runtime system? That sounds big!&rdquo; It is not. In fact, [Elm assets are exceptionally small](https://elm-lang.org/blog/small-assets-without-the-headache) when compared to React, Angular, Vue, etc.

> **Note 2:** We are going to use packages from [`package.elm-lang.org`](https://package.elm-lang.org) in the upcoming examples. We have already been working with a couple:
>
> - [`elm/core`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/core/latest/)
> - [`elm/html`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/html/latest/)
>
> But now we will start getting into some fancier ones:
>
> - [`elm/random`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/random/latest/)
> - [`elm/time`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/)
> - [`elm/json`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/)
> - [`elm/http`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/http/latest/)
>
> There are tons of other packages on `package.elm-lang.org` though! So when you are making your own Elm programs locally, it will probably involve running some commands like this in the terminal:
>
>```bash
elm init
elm install elm/random
elm install elm/http
```
>
> That would set up an `elm.json` file with `elm/random` and `elm/http` as dependencies.
>
> I will be mentioning the packages we are using in the following examples, so I hope this gives some context on what that is all about!
